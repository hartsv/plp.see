Fun Calculator
ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Fun Calculator! ðŸŽ‰

This is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. Let's make math fun! ðŸ˜Ž

Features
Prompts the user for two numbers (with support for decimal inputs)
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Displays the results in a friendly format

Code Walkthrough
Here's a brief overview of the code components:

Asks for the first number from the user (supports decimal input).
Asks for the second number from the user (supports decimal input).
Computes:
The sum of the two numbers.
The difference by subtracting the second number from the first.
The product by multiplying the two numbers.
The quotient by dividing the first number by the second (Note: The script does not currently handle division by zero).
Displays the results in an easy-to-read format.
Example
Here's how it looks in action:

yaml
